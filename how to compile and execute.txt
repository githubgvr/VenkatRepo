Installation on Windows
In order to run Objective-C program on windows, we need to install MinGW and GNUStep Core. Both are available at http://www.gnu.org/software/gnustep/windows/installer.html.

First, we need to install the MSYS/MinGW System package. Then, we need to install the GNUstep Core package. Both of which provide a windows installer, which is self-explanatory.

Then to use Objective-C and GNUstep by selecting Start -> All Programs -> GNUstep -> Shell

Switch to the folder containing helloWorld.m

We can compile the program by using:

$ gcc `gnustep-config --objc-flags` -L /GNUstep/System/Library/Libraries hello.m -o hello -lgnustep-base -lobjc
We can run the program by using:

./hello.exe
We get the following output:
